# Data Science Workshop  -  Introduction to Data Science in [R](http://cran.us.r-project.org/) -

This introductory workshop on the **23. May 2018** provides training in data mining with the [R](http://cran.us.r-project.org/) environment. Examples presented in the workshop will focus on applications in natural and life sciences. R is a quickly developing tool for data analysis, embraced both by academia and industry (Google, Microsoft or Facebook). This workshop will introduce attendees to key concepts of data science and give a hands-on experience without requiring a previous knowledge of [R](http://cran.us.r-project.org/).


The workshop is part of the [International Biotech Innovation Days](https://ibid-2018.b2match.io/), wich will take place from the 23 - 25 May 2018 in [Senftenberg, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senftenberg) at the [Brandenburg University of Technology (BTU) Cottbus – Senftenberg](https://www.b-tu.de/en/) (Campus Senftenberg).

Since the IBID is an **open access conference**, participation is **free of charge<u></u>**.

The workshop will cover fundamental topics including:

- getting to know [R](http://cran.us.r-project.org/) packages and R-related tools for data science
- data manipulation (import of data, summarizing and transforming large volumes of data),
- data visualization (graphical exploratory analysis, visualization of predictive models),
- machine learning (feature selection, tuning of predictors).

Exercises from this workshop employ data from life sciences, with a special focus on bioinformatics. Despite that fact, skills mastered during this event can be easily transferred to other applications. 



## Target audience:

The course is tailored for attendees with little to no experience with [R](http://cran.us.r-project.org/). Any programming experience is welcomed, but not required to participate in the workshop. Topics touched during the workshop stuits equally needs of participants from industry and research.

## Requirements:

To participate in this course you are required to bring your own laptop, with a recent version of [R](http://cran.us.r-project.org/) ( http://cran.us.r-project.org/ ) and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) ( https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ ). To install necessary packages and download data run in [R](http://cran.us.r-project.org/) the following script:

```

## Registration:

Although the event is free of charge, participants must register under [https://ibid-2018.b2match.io/signup](https://ibid-2018.b2match.io/signup), as available places are limited and information is required for certified participation. Participation in the free IBID conference is not necessary.
