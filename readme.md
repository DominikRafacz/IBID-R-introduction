This introductory workshop provides training in data mining with the R environment. Examples presented in the workshop will focus on applications in natural and life sciences. R is a quickly developing tool for data analysis, embraced both by academia and industry (Google, Microsoft or Facebook). This workshop will introduce attendees to key concepts of data science and give a hands-on experience without requiring a previous knowledge of R.

The workshop will cover fundamental topics including:

- getting to know R packages and R-related tools for data science
- data manipulation (import of data, summarizing and transforming large volumes of data),
- data visualization (graphical exploratory analysis, visualization of predictive models),
- machine learning (feature selection, tuning of predictors).

Exercises from this workshop employ data from life sciences, with a special focus on bioinformatics. Despite that fact, skills mastered during this event can be easily transferred to other applications. 

## Target audience:

The course is tailored for attendees with little to no experience with R. Any programming experience is welcomed, but not required to participate in the workshop. Topics touched during the workshop stuits equally needs of participants from industry and research.

## Requirements:

To participate in this course you are required to bring your own laptop, with a recent version of R ( http://cran.us.r-project.org/ ) and Rstudio ( https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ ). To install necessary packages and download data run in R the following script:
